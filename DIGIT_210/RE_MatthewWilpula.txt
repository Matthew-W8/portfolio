(There was a lot so I feel it would be a waste to put here, but I can confirm it worked)
*I wanted to make sure it was actually working. It was.

VS Strike <points num="4.2">4.2</points></stat>
VS Slash <points num="5.8">5.8</points></stat>
VS Pierce <points num="5.2">5.2</points></stat>

//points[contains(.,"4.")]
*I didn't get this to return anything, but I thought it would return all <points> that contains a stat starting with 4.

*I wanted to see if it would return comments (It does) but it only return the first "<".

^[starts-with(<\W)]
This returned the beginning every line because all sections after root are indented but the indent counts.

*How would I write it so it would only return new lines starting with <!-- because it just seems to ignore the !--
*Also, is there any way to write an exclusion with regular expressions. Say I had a nested tag, but only wanted the text. Is there anyway I could exclude anything inside a "<>" from returning?
