        <h1>Review of <i>Coelum</i>:</h1>
        <p>Coelum is a short game that explores the world of Coelum. While the game play is minimalistic at best, it serves as a neat introduction to the world of Coelum.
           The gameplay itself is just three fetch quests that serve to introduce the player to characters in the world which exist to serve as an introduction to the characters of this world.
        <p>The characters themselves are bland, but, given the game's length and limited quests, you couldn't expect much else. The character's are only named after their profession and, when
            interacted with, don't provide much for conversation. they usually spout a line about where to go or how you can help them or thanking you for your help. However, this game is more or
            less an advertisement for the book it's world is based on, so the limited character in the characters is excusable.</p>

        <p>The world the character's reside in, however, is rich and raises a lot of questions for the player. The regular citizens are adorned in gas masks, there is a strange knight that is much taller than the everyone else,
            and what's that strange column in the forest? The game itself doesn't answer these questions, but sets them up to entice the player to go read the book to answer these questions.</p>

        <p>The environment in the game is made up of five small maps split into four areas. The first maps are in the main town the player begins in. It is adorned with yellow-ish brick houses reminiscent of those found in pueblos. The next area
            is the forest. The forest mainly serves as a crossroad connecting the other three areas. It is covered in pink leafed trees. The next area is the cliffside, a small patch of grass overlooking a cliff with large
            spire-shaped rocks in the distance. The last area is downtown, which has the foliage of the forest combined with the houses of the town.</p>

        <p>Now, as stated before, the gameplay is very minimalistic. It is three simple fetch quests in which you talk to someone, retrieve what they wanted, and then they thank you. The first one
            the player is likely to run into the town crier who asks you to find his pet, which has conveniently knocked down the item for the next fetch quest. Once completed the crier prays for you
            and you're free to move on. The next quest is retrieving the food, which the crier's pet has knocked over, for the monk. Same as before, the player retrieves the food, is thanked, and moves on. The 
            last quest is to retrieve a shield-like object for Dakka the Green. Simply grab the object and return it to him. For your help you are rewarded with a story and the end of the game. The quests
            don't have to be completed in this order, but the game will end after all three are completed. Because of the simplicity of the quests and the controls, the game is very accessible to any sort of player.
            The only keys that do anything are "X" and "WASD" or the arrow keys. "X" is to interact with others or objects and the other keys are how the player moves.</p>
