        <h1>Review of <i>Coelum</i>:</h1>
        <p>Coelum is a short game that explores the world of Coelum. While the game play is mimalistic at best, it serves as a neat introduction to the world of Coelum.
        The gameplay itself is just three fetch quests that serve to introduce the player to characters in the world, and to help qive us a sense of the importance of religion
        and the societal heirachry of this world. The structues of the buildings and the flora of the 
        surroundings immediatly show the player they are somewhere else. The way the characters dress helps to provide this as well. The average citzens are dressed in 
        gasmask garb and more important characters wear strange attire such as weird helmet or are just a straight-up warrior robot with sci-fi weaponery. The game also has few
        meta moments in which the citzens that line the street just reference that their doing nothing except stand their or walk back and forth. The game does fall short in some
        areas. As stated before the gameplay is very minimal with it only being three fetch quests which don't invoke that much joy in the player and certain sections have areas
        that would make you think they lead to somewhere else, but it just lets the player walk off-screen leading to much confusion trying to get the player character back on screen</p>
