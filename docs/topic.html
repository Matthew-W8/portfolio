            <h1>Overcommercialization of Video Games</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Main Topic</h2>
                <p>Over time, video games are becoming more an more a product over art. Like movies, they are succumbing, and in my opinion even faster, to
                the woes of easy money. Whether it be adding product placement or full on advertisements to interupt your time.</p>

                <h2>In-app purchases</h2>
                <p>Some of my best memories as a child are sitting in the back of my parent's car playing mobile games on my Kindle. 
                    After some nostalgic explortion, I came to the conclusion that most of them were bad, yet there was something special about them.
                    To me, it's the fact that those games were made to be enjoyed, not a products. Now most mobile games follow a "freemium" format.
                    The game itself is free, however, this leads to it being packed full of ads and in-app purchases, often without an option to just
                    pay to disable ads.</p>
                <p>This can create harmful enviorments where vulnerable people, i.e. those with prexisting conditions that make them more prone to 
                gambling or hoarding, get stuck in loops where they have to obtain everything this game has to offer. This brings to mind the
                concept of gacha games, but that is a slightly more nuanced subject when compared to virtual currency conversion in these types of games.</p>
                <p>While developers have to make money someway, most of the ways that do that come off incessantly disrupting or greedy. The best ways I have
                seen it is to provide the option to buy currency to advance faster. While I still think it's not great, it is much more of an option rather than
                a requirment to access content. The other more player friendly-way is the option to watch ads for rewards. Rather than making the advertisement
                a requirment, let the user decide if they want to watch an ad. I'm more than happy to set my phone down for thirty seconds and not look at
                the screen if I know I'm getting a reward. It's a win-win scenario. I get rewards, the developers make money, and the advertisers lose money.</p>

                <h2>Advertising in Games</h2>
                <p>One of the best ways to devalue a piece of media than to turn it into a advertisment filled nightmare. Well if the sounds like
                    something that you'd want in you game or other piece of media, take a look at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/6268038/videogamecollection/items/6VRHV62A/attachment/XKXKMH3P/reader">Amazon's own webpage to buy advertisments</a>. 
                Now you, with Amazon's help, can interupt a gaming expierence to shove unwanted ads down your purchasers throat. The best way to
                make people absoluetly love your game is to make people expierence ads for full price.</p>
