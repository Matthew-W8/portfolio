            <h1>Over commercialization of Video Games</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Main Topic</h2>
                <p>Over time, video games are becoming more and more a product over art. Like movies, they are succumbing, and in my opinion even faster, to
                    the woes of easy money. Whether it be adding product placement or full-on advertisements to interrupt your time. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>In-app purchases</h2>
                <p>Some of my best memories as a child are sitting in the back of my parent's car playing mobile games on my Kindle. 
                    After some nostalgic exploration, I concluded that most of them were bad, yet there was something special about them.
                    To me, it's the fact that those games were made to be enjoyed, not a product. Now most mobile games follow a "freemium" format.
                    The game itself is free, however, this leads to it being packed full of ads and in-app purchases, often without an option to just
                    pay to disable ads.</p>
                <p>This can create harmful environments where vulnerable people, i.e. those with preexisting conditions that make them more prone to 
                    gambling or hoarding, get stuck in loops where they have to obtain everything this game has to offer. This brings to mind the
                    concept of gacha games, but that is a slightly more nuanced subject when compared to virtual currency conversion in these types of games. </p>
                <p>While developers must make money someway, most of the ways that do that come off incessantly disrupting or greedy. The best way I have
                    seen it is to provide the option to buy currency to advance faster. While I still think it's not great, it is much more of an option rather than
                    a requirement to access content. The other more player friendly way is the option to watch ads for rewards. Rather than making the advertisement
                    a requirement, let the user decide if they want to watch an ad. I'm more than happy to set my phone down for thirty seconds and not look at
                    the screen if I know I'm getting a reward. It's a win-win scenario. I get rewards, the developers make money, and the advertisers lose money. </p>

                <h2>Advertising in Games</h2>
                <p>One of the best ways to devalue a piece of media than to turn it into an advertisement filled nightmare. Well, if the sounds like
                    something that you'd want in your game or other piece of media, look at <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/6268038/videogamecollection/items/6VRHV62A/attachment/XKXKMH3P/reader">Amazon's own webpage to buy advertisements</a>. 
                    Now you, with Amazon's help, can interrupt a gaming experience to shove unwanted ads down your purchaser’s throat. The best way to
                    make people absolutely love your game is to make people experience ads for full price.</p>
