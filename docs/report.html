        <p class="reflection">While both Wordpress and HTML allow a user to create a website, each does so in a very different way. Wordpress allows for website to put up easily and quickly, but lacks the precision that HTML can provide. HTML's strong suit is that it allows the creator to manipulate any piece of their website to make their website appear how they want. However, in order to that, it requires the creator to understand HTML and get to a point where they are proficient at it before thier vision can come to life. Wordpress just allows the creator to use a template and just begin adding content onto their webpage.</p>
        <p class="reflection">The two systems also differ in their complexity. While HTML seems more complex at first glance, once a creator begins to grasp an understanding of it, it starts to appear simple and understandable. Wordpress on the other hand, seems simple at first, but as a creator digs deeper into how Wordpress functions certain faults start to appear, such as the save and publish buttons frequently being distanced from the content or simple customization options being hidden in layers and layers of menus.</p>
        <p class="reflection">HTML allows for more precision when developing your website, but in order to get a website to look the way a creator might want it to, it requires a lot of work. However, Wordpress doesn't allow that much customization at all. The most a creator can do is change basic colors and chose a template they like, but it is much faster than making a website in HTML.</p>
        <p class="reflection">In conclusion, each program has their benefits depending on the situation. Wordpress allows for a quick and nice looking website if you're short on time. HTML allows for a website to look exactly how a creator would want it to, but it requires quite the amount of time invested to both learn the HTML required and make the website itself.
