        <h1 style="text-align: center">Comparison of 1815-1850 fiction and Inagural Addresses</h1>
        <p>I chose to compare fiction from the years 1815 to 1850 and the inaugural addresses from the corresponding years. In my research
        I came across interesting comparisons between the two. Fiction from the time period uses more negative words to suggest a hard time whereas
        the inaugural addresses use more positive words to suggest times of prosperity and change.</p>
        <p>The first thing I noticed was that the fiction data set contained a lot more negative words such as "don't" or "can't" whereas the inaugural
        addresses contain more positive words such as "will be" and "it is".</p>

        <p>This would leave me to believe that the Presidents are speaking about how their time as President will be a positive impact on the
            country while the fiction is reflecting a time of hardship. Even though it is a fiction set, fiction often still reflects the world of
            the time.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, "The United States" appears in both data sets, albeit it appears far more in the government data set, but I think it still says
        something that it still appears in the data set at all. "The President" is also mentioned in the fiction data set as well.</p>

        <p>As mention before the fiction pieces are likely reflecting how people felt about the time period. This is proven when we view the 
        "The United States" ngrams in keyword in context. Viewing "The President" from the fiction data set also helps to prove this.</p>

        <p>"The United States" is followed by negative words in the fiction data set such as "but" or is followed by past tense words suggesting something could have been done different
        like "was" and "were", but in the addresses data set it is followed by "to" or "has" to suggest a better time to come. "The President" is also mentioned
        in the fiction data set but the following words does not reveal much about the President of the time. Most of the words suggest they were just
        doing their job, however in one keyword in context he is called a "cherished friend".</p>
        <p>Lastly, when the highest negative ngrams from the fiction data set are searched for, we can see that see that they are not mentioned at
        all in the inaugural addresses data set. This leads me to believe that during the addresses the Presidents are refraining from using negative words
        during their speeches to either focus on how they can improve the country or to try and lessen their association to negative words.</p>

        <p>The different ngrams and KWIC views would leave me to believe that the early 19th century was a time of hardship in the United States. The
        Presidents were attempting to improve the country, but, as the fiction data set would suggest, it wasn't helping. However, from the keyword in context view of "The President"
        it would suggest that they still had the support of the people.</p>
