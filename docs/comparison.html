        <p>In my research, it seems that the 19th century fiction uses more negative words like "don't" or "couldn't" while the addresses use postive words like "will" and "may be". I think their is something to compare here between the negativity in the fiction and the postivity in the addresses which may reveal something about the time period.</p>
